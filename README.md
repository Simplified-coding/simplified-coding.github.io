# This is the Simplified Coding website!

Welcome! Here you'll find all the files for our website. Feel free to play around and make Simplified Coding yours!

## Where can I find the lessons?

We keep our lessons in an MDX format. You can find them and `/src/pages/lessons/THE_LESSON_YOU_WANT`.

## Is this under copyright?

Simplified Coding is all about free software. You can use our software for free, which is under the GNU General Public License Version 3 (And above). We have stored it at `/LICENSE`

## I found a security issue! Where do I report it?

You can report all security vulnerabilities on GitHub. You can learn more about our security policy, which is at `SECURITY.md`.

## Cool! What is Simplified Coding... made of?

Simplified Coding used to be more... Simple. The first version of the website was just plain HTML and CSS. Now we have evolved it and the base of our page is Astro. Also, our lessons are in MDX, we use Bootstrap as a CSS framework, and we use Vercel to deploy changes to the site. We also use codemirror as our editor for the website and Pyodide for Python.

## Oh and... one more question. Why is your GitHub in English but the website in Greek?

Well, we are all based in Greece and our goal is to bring coding to Greek students. English coding content is overwhelming so there is no point in making another coding source in English. We choose to use English in GitHub so everyone can see our work, even if they don't fully understand the content.
